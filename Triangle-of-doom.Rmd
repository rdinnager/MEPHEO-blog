This is the first of probably many blog posts in which I muse about peculiarities of statistical practice in Ecology. Most ecologists have a very idiosyncratic, patch-work understanding of statistics, understandably largely based around the particular methods that they need for their work. This leads to some interesting statistical reading---with many highs, and many many lows. I will probably mainly focus on the lows, in an attempt to get a conversation started about what is the best statistical practice in certain areas that come up a lot in the literature. I should say, I am no exception to the general pattern in my own understanding of statistics---it can be quite incomplete on a number of fronts. That is why I welcome anyone who knows more about a particular statistical problem that I am discussing to correct me if I am horrendously (or even midly) wrong.

Today I wish to talk about what I am calling the "Triangle of Doom", which pops up a lot in Ecology.
